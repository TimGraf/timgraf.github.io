        <h1 class="text-center">Predator Prey Flocking/Schooling Model</h1>
        <p class="text-center">
            More than just being intersting to watch, the more intersting part of modeling flocking/schooling behavior is that it is an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            Basic models of flocking behaviour are controlled by three simple rules:

            <li>Separation - Avoid crowding neighbours (short range repulsion)</li>
            <li>Alignment - Steer towards average heading of neighbours</li>
            <li>Cohesion - Steer towards average position of neighbours (long range attraction)</li>
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            In this project I wanted to add additional and unique behaviors for the predators and the prey. The prey get an avoid behavior to avoid the predators, and the predators get a chase behavior, to chase the prey.

        <p class="text-center">The idea behind this project was to implement <a href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/" target="_blank">Boids</a> in Javascript and also add predators to chase the schooling fish.</p>

        <p class="text-center">The idea came from seeing an arial view of sharks swimming though a school of fish. See the images below.</p>

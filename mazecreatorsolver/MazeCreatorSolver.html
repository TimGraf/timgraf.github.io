        <h1 class="text-center">Knight's Tour in JavaScript with Visualization</h1>
        <p class="text-center">I was asked to create an algorithm to solve a maze on an interview once.  The maze was represented by a matrix of 1's and 0's where a 0 was a wall.  I failed miserably because solving algorithms in interviews is something I am not good at.  But the problem was intersting so I decided to create this project to not only solve a maze but also generate the maze to solve.  I also added some very simple ASCII graphics.</p>

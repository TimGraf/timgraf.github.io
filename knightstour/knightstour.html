    <h1 class="text-center">Knight's Tour in JavaScript with Visualization</h1>
    <p class="text-center">After seeing my manager ask a candidate during an interview to create an algorithm for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour" target="_blank">The Knight's Tour</a>, I decide to try this on my own in JavaScript with visualization.  I'm glad I've never been asked this in an interview.  It was a pain and it took me an entre Saturday and then some to wrte this.  I also kept the board size down to 5 by 5 for performance reasons.</p>
